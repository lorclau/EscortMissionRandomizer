# Escort Mission Randomizer
This is a role randomizer designed to be used with Escort Mission - available in Genshin's Miliastra Wonderland.

## How to use
Type particpants names, press enter or "add" to add them to the participants list. You can add or delete participants at any time.

Drag-and-drop to reorganize particpants. Click assign roles to assign roles to the players in attackers/defenders.

### Buttons
**Randomize participants** - place all participants into random teams (attackers or defenders)

**Remix teams** - only randomize players who are already in teams

**Swap teams** - swaps attackers and defenders

**Assign roles** - assigns random in-game roles to each player

**Copy** - copies the outcome of the randomization to your clipboard for easy pasting into single text areas

### Additional Options
**Assign Categories Only** - will assign each player a category (healer, tank, dps, or assassin). Players can decide in-game which specific role they want to play, so long as it is in the category they recieved.

**No double healer** - each team will be assigned no more than one healer. This is to prevent unfair gameplay and provide more control over the randomization.

**Identical Team Comp** - will assign the same roles/categories to attackers and defenders. This means both teams will play with the same team comp.
